Software Developer (Automation & APIs)

**[Main Narrative]**
I believe the next massive leap in business productivity will come from combining intelligent automation with AI agents. This conviction is what drove me to transition from designing workflows to building the software that powers them, and I've been fascinated with the possibilities ever since.

My approach is hands-on and results-oriented. I am a dedicated, hard-working learner who is always ready to absorb new information to find the best solution for the challenge at hand. I am actively deepening my expertise in asynchronous programming and API design—the foundational skills for creating fast, reliable, and scalable automated systems.

I'm a strong communicator who thrives on architecting the right solution and look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to a team building the future of productivity.
